This week was easier than last for sure. I'm still fairly fuzzy on ajax calls. I think i just need a review on syntax that i can study. The break i think still comes from the request response cycle. .put .post etc.

I think during the break i'm going to rewatch a lot of the lectures from weeks 2 and 3.
