# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Today was a good day, a little weird, but I liked it. It was good though. A couple of notes.

  1. it was good to see the whole trajectory of the class
  2. git is definitely more complicated than i thought
  3. I think i'm going to have trouble editing the existing code base, it will certinaly be different.

I am looking forwad to paired programming though, it will be had, but it will be good.
