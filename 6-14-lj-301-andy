#Learning Journal-I made a single page web app

I only realized after i did it that we made a single page web app today. That's pretty fucking cool. THAT BEING SAID, single page is a bit of a misnomer, becuase i needed like 10 jquery pages and a bajillion css pages to do it, but sure, there was one HTML doc.

You can definitely tell it's faster though!

This class has been pretty interesting, i feel like everyone super duper competent, so you feel like a bit of a god working in pairs.
